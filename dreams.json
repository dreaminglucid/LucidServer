    "analysis": "This dream signifies your current life journey. The pyramid itself is symbolic of stability and endurance, perhaps due to some challenges you're enduring or about to face. By traveling through the endless tunnels, it's a sign that your subconscious believes you are on a long and potentially complex journey.\n\nThe puzzles represent the various challenges or decisions you have to make in your life. These could be related to your personal or professional life. The fact that you're solving them in the dream suggests that you have the skills and resources required to overcome these issues.\n\nFighting monsters can be seen as a representation of your fears or obstacles. By fighting these monsters, it indicates that you are confronting your problems and fears directly rather than avoiding them. \n\nThe nature of the monsters would provide more insight into what specific obstacles or fears you're dealing with. For example, if the monsters are people from your waking life, they may symbolize individuals with whom you have conflicts or difficulties.\n\nOverall, this dream encourages inner strength, perseverance, problem-solving skills, and confronting fears. It might be pointing towards a complex situation in your waking life that needs problem-solving and courage.",

    "analysis": "This dream implies that you might be undergoing a period of struggle or challenge where you might feel as though you are 'falling' or failing in some aspect. The presence of a friend saving you can suggest that you have a support system in place that you can depend on when you are struggling. It may indicate a subconscious appreciation and trust towards your friends. Overall, it encourages you to lean on your friends and not face your challenges alone. Additionally, it might reflect your fear of failure and the reassurance that there are people around you who will help pick you up during tough times.",

It might mean you are feeling detached from your old self or ways, signalling an end to your old attitudes, habits, or different aspects of your life.

    "analysis": "This dream can be interpreted in several ways and the meaning might vary depending on the personal experiences and life situations of the dreamer. Generally, swimming in open ocean signifies that you're navigating through your emotions, your subconscious, or facing something uncertain in your life. The darkness can suggest a lack of clarity or can symbolize the unknown. The endless miles seem to indicate you're involved in a long, ongoing process or journey. If in your dream, you felt scared or anxious, it could be suggesting that you're feeling overwhelmed by a situation in your waking life, and it appears to be endless. If you felt calm or at peace while swimming, it suggests that you're embracing these uncertainties and successfully navigating through your emotions.",

The jungle aspect can portray a symbol of chaos and uncontrollability, possibly referring to aspects of your daily life that are chaotic or unpredictable. The fact it's set thousands of years ago might mean you're looking for simplicity or fundamental values in lifeâ€”that you might be feeling overwhelmed by technology or modern life worries. This sense of primordial living could also suggest a need for survival or expressing basic instincts. Could also suggest a yearning for a more natural, straightforward, and instinctive lifestyle.",

There is a river maybe 50 feet down the hill and about 20 feet ahead of us there is a bunch of cat tails covering the ground that leads down to the river. It's a party type setting.. Feels like a 4th of July party... I'm sitting next to Cody and Darian.. Jake is there too but he went down into the brush to go find some people. There are also people all around us. \nWe are sitting on the hill watching the moon... We are expecting the super moon to come any moment. When it finally starts to happen I get a rush of heavy intuition that something very big is about to happen. I could feel it see it smell it taste it touch it in the air. As soon as the moon starts weening into the red full super moon.. I knew what was going to happen. My entire vision became shaky.. And all of the sudden as I'm watching the moon progress... It explodes... Implodes... It was the most real thing you could ever imagine.. It may as well have really happened. I felt the heat from the explosion and the shift of gravity taking place on the earth. I realized in a few seconds what was really about to happen. That huge fire ball is about to evaporate our planet.. And if that doesn't do it... We are going to get knocked off of our gravitational path and the entire world will crack and scream. I knew I was going to die, and that every one around me was going to die. I look at Cody and Darian.. They are paralyzed in fear... I look down at the brush and see its on fire... I realize that Jake is in the brush... Thinking he's Already dead or dying.. This led me to turn around from the moon and close my eyes... Accept everything that is happening. I close my eyes and feeling the vibration of the shifting planet and the heat from the explosion, I make a wish to be with Abigail. I embody the feeling of death and I think about Abby in my assumed last moments... As soon as the thought hit and the second went by in which I was almost certain I would die, I get a warm burst of air hit my back.. A comforting warm burst... Soothing around the silhouette of my body.. \nI realize in this moment that I'm not going to die... I turn around and the adrenaline kicks in... I see Jake also coming out of the burning brush with a girl over his shoulder... Hauling his way out with sweet and blood. I shake Cody and Darian to see if they are ok.. They were responsive but in complete shock... I then, woke up ",
    "analysis": "Interpreting dreams is subjective and can be influenced by personal emotions, past experiences, and current situations. Dreams often serve as a way for our subconsciousness to process and deal with our emotional state.\n\nThe celestial event marking the supermoon in your dream could represent an anticipation or dread of some big event or major change in your waking life. The explosion of the moon and impending doom could symbolize an impact event, a dramatic change or the end of one phase leading to the start of a new one. This could coincide with an increased level of anxiety or stress about the potential outcome.\n\nYour companions: Cody, Darian, and Jake, may represent various aspects of your personality or individuals in your life who are integral to the situation. The fact you made a wish to be with Abigail indicates she represents someone you care for deeply, someone whom you seek for emotional support and wish to have by your side during difficult times. \n\nThe warm burst of air that hits your back and offers comfort suggests that, despite your fears and apprehensions, you have the inner strength and resilience to face and overcome the challenges thrown at you. This is further enforced by the scene where Jake is saving a girl from the burning brush, indicating the possibility of overcoming adversity despite the odds.\n\nYour waking up after checking on Cody and Darian can possibly signify that you're ready to confront the situation or feelings you are dealing with in real life. \n\nIt's essential to remember that dreams are personal and unique, and often the best person to interpret them is the dreamer themselves. Always take into account your feelings, experiences and emotions when interpreting your dreams.",

    "analysis": "It appears your dream contains several symbolic elements. Falling into a volcano may represent a situation in your waking life where you're entering a potentially dangerous or heated situation -- a circumstance that is unpredictable or volatile.\n\nDiscovering elves at the bottom of the volcano, meanwhile, can have different representations depending on your cultural background or personal beliefs. In general, elves are perceived as mystical creatures, often representing magic and wisdom. Encountering them in your dream might symbolize that you're discovering something unexpected, magical or wise within a risky, potentially destructive situation. \n\nKeep in mind, dreams are highly subjective and personal. These explanations are general interpretations and might not be wholly applicable to you. If the dream reflects or reminds you of any personal life situations, it's good to consider those perspectives as well.",
