The monsters symbolize fears or difficult situations you are dealing with. Fighting these monsters indicates your determination and will power to face these fears or challenges in your waking life. This is not a negative dream, it is about personal growth, self-discovery and overcoming challenges.",

    "analysis": "This dream can represent a number of different things depending on your personal life context. In general, falling in a dream might symbolize a feeling of losing control or fear of failure in some aspect of your waking life. It could reflect feelings of uncertainty or insecurities over a situation or decision. The building might represent a high ambition or goal that you've set for yourself.\n\nBeing saved by a friend in your dream can suggest that you may be relying on or seeking support from this person, or it might mean you'll need their help in some future situation. This could also symbolize a deep trust, appreciation, and connection with your friend.\n\nHowever, the meaning of dreams can be very personal, and what they represent can vary greatly for each individual depending on their life experiences and current circumstances. These interpretations are general and may not necessarily apply to your specific situation.

It can suggest that you're undergoing a transformative phase in your life, where you're putting behind aspects of your old self and beginning a new chapter. You might be releasing old habits, attitudes, and relationships that no longer serve your growth.

The ocean is vast and seemingly endless, similar to the challenges, experiences, or emotions that you feel are overwhelming or you're struggling with. \n\nBeing in the dark implies you could be feeling uncertain or anxious about not knowing what lies ahead, indicating possible confusion or lack of clarity about your direction in life.\n\nSwimming indicates that despite these challenges or emotions, you are actively making an effort to navigate through the situation.

The jungle aspect can portray a symbol of chaos and uncontrollability, possibly referring to aspects of your daily life that are chaotic or unpredictable. The fact it's set thousands of years ago might mean you're looking for simplicity or fundamental values in life—that you might be feeling overwhelmed by technology or modern life worries. This sense of primordial living could also suggest a need for survival or expressing basic instincts. Could also suggest a yearning for a more natural, straightforward, and instinctive lifestyle.",

There is a river maybe 50 feet down the hill and about 20 feet ahead of us there is a bunch of cat tails covering the ground that leads down to the river. It's a party type setting.. Feels like a 4th of July party... I'm sitting next to Cody and Darian.. Jake is there too but he went down into the brush to go find some people. There are also people all around us. \nWe are sitting on the hill watching the moon... We are expecting the super moon to come any moment. When it finally starts to happen I get a rush of heavy intuition that something very big is about to happen. I could feel it see it smell it taste it touch it in the air. As soon as the moon starts weening into the red full super moon.. I knew what was going to happen. My entire vision became shaky.. And all of the sudden as I'm watching the moon progress... It explodes... Implodes... It was the most real thing you could ever imagine.. It may as well have really happened. I felt the heat from the explosion and the shift of gravity taking place on the earth. I realized in a few seconds what was really about to happen. That huge fire ball is about to evaporate our planet.. And if that doesn't do it... We are going to get knocked off of our gravitational path and the entire world will crack and scream. I knew I was going to die, and that every one around me was going to die. I look at Cody and Darian.. They are paralyzed in fear... I look down at the brush and see its on fire... I realize that Jake is in the brush... Thinking he's Already dead or dying.. This led me to turn around from the moon and close my eyes... Accept everything that is happening. I close my eyes and feeling the vibration of the shifting planet and the heat from the explosion, I make a wish to be with Abigail. I embody the feeling of death and I think about Abby in my assumed last moments... As soon as the thought hit and the second went by in which I was almost certain I would die, I get a warm burst of air hit my back.. A comforting warm burst... Soothing around the silhouette of my body.. \nI realize in this moment that I'm not going to die... I turn around and the adrenaline kicks in... I see Jake also coming out of the burning brush with a girl over his shoulder... Hauling his way out with sweet and blood. I shake Cody and Darian to see if they are ok.. They were responsive but in complete shock... I then, woke up ",
    "analysis": "Your dream seems to be filled with powerful emotions and vivid imagery, reflecting quite a few aspects of your subconscious mind. A super moon often suggests heightened intuition and increased emotional awareness. However, its explosion might indicate a situation or relationship in your waking life that has reached a boiling point or is nearing a dramatic conclusion. This experience triggers a revelation about your own mortality and the fragility of life.\n\nThe fire might symbolize transformation or destruction, depending on the context. The fact that you feel the heat and see the fire in the bush where Jake went implies that a challenging situation might be facing someone close to you or people around you. It might manifest as an emergency or crisis that necessitates immediate attention.\n\nThe fear and paralysis displayed by Cody and Darian might reflect feelings of helplessness or fear in the face of adversity or a drastic situation, which could be reflective of your perception regarding how your loved ones might react to certain circumstances.\n\nAlso, your desire to be with Abigail in what you thought were your final moments suggests that you harbor deep feelings or a strong bond for this person. The fact that you did not die and felt a comforting warm burst suggests resilience, transformation, and hope in the face of adversity.\n\nWaking up after such a dramatic dream can indicate that you are ready to face a new day and confront whatever challenges that come your way. It is advisable to consider your feelings and emotions in your waking life and relate them to the dream to make sense of it. If this dream recurs or continues to trouble you, you may want to consider speaking to a mental health professional.",

It can relate to different aspects of your waking life where you feel you're lacking clarity or need guidance.\n\nThe darkness or night symbolizes the unknown and the subconscious.

    "analysis": "Your dream seems to be combining several aspects of your subconscious thoughts, fears, and desires. \n\nWaking up in the middle of a busy highway suggests feelings of fear, chaos, and confusion in waking life. These might represent your current thoughts about how you're navigating through life or a situation that's chaotic, stressful and almost out of control. It could also signify living a fast-paced or high-pressure lifestyle where one mistake could be catastrophic.\n\nDodging the cars could potentially indicate that you are avoiding or handling many obstacles and challenges thrown in your way in real life. This act of a daring move can either stem from a feeling of desperation or growth in confidence and adeptness in dealing with difficulties.\n\nRiding a car into NYC could be your subconscious’ message that despite the obstacles that may come your way, there is a decision or direction that will lead you to a place associated with energy, ambition, and new opportunities (symbolized by the representation of NYC as a land of dreams and growth).\n\nOverall, this dream seems to be a strong message from your subconscious that even though you may face hard challenges, you have ample resilience and agility to handle and possibly overpower them.
