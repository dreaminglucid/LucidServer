    "analysis": "This dream signifies your current life journey. The pyramid itself is symbolic of stability and endurance, perhaps due to some challenges you're enduring or about to face. By traveling through the endless tunnels, it's a sign that your subconscious believes you are on a long and potentially complex journey.\n\nThe puzzles represent the various challenges or decisions you have to make in your life. These could be related to your personal or professional life. The fact that you're solving them in the dream suggests that you have the skills and resources required to overcome these issues.\n\nFighting monsters can be seen as a representation of your fears or obstacles. By fighting these monsters, it indicates that you are confronting your problems and fears directly rather than avoiding them. \n\nThe nature of the monsters would provide more insight into what specific obstacles or fears you're dealing with. For example, if the monsters are people from your waking life, they may symbolize individuals with whom you have conflicts or difficulties.\n\nOverall, this dream encourages inner strength, perseverance, problem-solving skills, and confronting fears. It might be pointing towards a complex situation in your waking life that needs problem-solving and courage.",

    "analysis": "This dream can represent a number of different things depending on your personal life context. In general, falling in a dream might symbolize a feeling of losing control or fear of failure in some aspect of your waking life. It could reflect feelings of uncertainty or insecurities over a situation or decision. The building might represent a high ambition or goal that you've set for yourself.\n\nBeing saved by a friend in your dream can suggest that you may be relying on or seeking support from this person, or it might mean you'll need their help in some future situation. This could also symbolize a deep trust, appreciation, and connection with your friend.\n\nHowever, the meaning of dreams can be very personal, and what they represent can vary greatly for each individual depending on their life experiences and current circumstances. These interpretations are general and may not necessarily apply to your specific situation.

If you feel no fear while swimming, it means you confidently face deep emotions and unconscious aspects of your personality. If you feel fear, you might be reluctant to confront these elements. The darkness could signify confusion or uncertainty about your path in life. Endless miles could mean that you're feeling a situation or problem in your life is ongoing, with no end in sight.

The jungle aspect can portray a symbol of chaos and uncontrollability, possibly referring to aspects of your daily life that are chaotic or unpredictable. The fact it's set thousands of years ago might mean you're looking for simplicity or fundamental values in lifeâ€”that you might be feeling overwhelmed by technology or modern life worries. This sense of primordial living could also suggest a need for survival or expressing basic instincts. Could also suggest a yearning for a more natural, straightforward, and instinctive lifestyle.",

Feels like a 4th of July party... I'm sitting next to Cody and Darian.. Jake is there too but he went down into the brush to go find some people. There are also people all around us. \nWe are sitting on the hill watching the moon... We are expecting the super moon to come any moment. When it finally starts to happen I get a rush of heavy intuition that something very big is about to happen. I could feel it see it smell it taste it touch it in the air. As soon as the moon starts weening into the red full super moon.. I knew what was going to happen. My entire vision became shaky.. And all of the sudden as I'm watching the moon progress... It explodes... Implodes... It was the most real thing you could ever imagine.. It may as well have really happened. I felt the heat from the explosion and the shift of gravity taking place on the earth. I realized in a few seconds what was really about to happen. That huge fire ball is about to evaporate our planet.. And if that doesn't do it... We are going to get knocked off of our gravitational path and the entire world will crack and scream. I knew I was going to die, and that every one around me was going to die. I look at Cody and Darian.. They are paralyzed in fear... I look down at the brush and see its on fire... I realize that Jake is in the brush... Thinking he's Already dead or dying.. This led me to turn around from the moon and close my eyes... Accept everything that is happening. I close my eyes and feeling the vibration of the shifting planet and the heat from the explosion, I make a wish to be with Abigail. I embody the feeling of death and I think about Abby in my assumed last moments... As soon as the thought hit and the second went by in which I was almost certain I would die, I get a warm burst of air hit my back.. A comforting warm burst... Soothing around the silhouette of my body.. \nI realize in this moment that I'm not going to die... I turn around and the adrenaline kicks in... I see Jake also coming out of the burning brush with a girl over his shoulder... Hauling his way out with sweet and blood. I shake Cody and Darian to see if they are ok.. They were responsive but in complete shock... I then, woke up ",
    "analysis": "Dreams are highly subjective, and interpretations can vary greatly depending on the individual's personal experiences, emotions, and associations. Here is a general analysis of your dream:\n\nA hill often symbolizes a challenge or obstacle you are facing or about to face in your waking life. The night setting might indicate that this situation is concerning or unclear to you.\n\nThe river at the bottom of the hill could symbolize the flow of your emotions or life. It might mean you are going through a difficult or emotional situation.\n\nThe 4th of July party could represent a celebration, symbolizing enjoyment and relaxation. It could also signify your desire for more social activities and happiness in your life.\n\nThe super moon typically signifies completion, high power, and clarity. However, the moon exploding in this dream could represent that something highly impactful and disruptive is happening in your life, which is causing you a lot of distress and fear.\n\nThe fire could symbolize destruction, transformation, and strong emotions. You might be feeling overwhelmed and afraid of changes and challenges that are taking place in waking life.\n\nSeeing your friends might indicate that you are thinking about them and they play an important role in your life. Your wish to be with Abigail could mean that you desire her comfort, support, or love during trying times.\n\nSurviving the catastrophic event could suggest that even though you're facing great difficulties, you can overcome them and come out stronger. \n\nRemember, only you can truly interpret your dreams.

These might represent your current thoughts about how you're navigating through life or a situation that's chaotic, stressful and almost out of control. It could also signify living a fast-paced or high-pressure lifestyle where one mistake could be catastrophic.\n\nDodging the cars could potentially indicate that you are avoiding or handling many obstacles and challenges thrown in your way in real life. This act of a daring move can either stem from a feeling of desperation or growth in confidence and adeptness in dealing with difficulties.\n\nRiding a car into NYC could be your subconsciousâ€™ message that despite the obstacles that may come your way, there is a decision or direction that will lead you to a place associated with energy, ambition, and new opportunities (symbolized by the representation of NYC as a land of dreams and growth).\n\nOverall, this dream seems to be a strong message from your subconscious that even though you may face hard challenges, you have ample resilience and agility to handle and possibly overpower them.
